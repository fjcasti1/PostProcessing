### How to create Flow Field Movies

Different steps:
1. **Generate the Restarts:** 
* First we need to generate the job record file using the `zmeta_ReSWEEP_JOB_REC` code in the DNS repository. Pay special attention to the number of periods we want in the movie, *NT*, the number of time steps per period, *NtsT*, so the simulation doesn't crash and the number of restarts (future frames) to generate. Should use a number of time steps per period multiple of the number of frames we want to capture.
```
  bash src/DNS/zmeta_ReSWEEP_JOB_REC
```
* The file generated doesn't have the restars location yet. We add it using `createinputs.py`.
```python
  python src/PostProcessing/createInputs.py ADDRS path/to/masterFile path/to/datFile
  ```
* Run the DNS. NOTE that the mode has to be MOVIEDNS in order for many output restarts not to be erased.
```
  parallel bash src/DNS/SWEEP_JOB_REC.sh {} 'D-HH:MM' 'delayTime' 'MOVIEDNS' 'comment' ::: path/to/inputrecFile
```
2. **Create Probing File**
```python
  python src/PostProcessing/createInputs.py PROBEMODE path/to/masterFile path/to/datFile path/to/store/MOVIEPROBE_MASTER
```

3. **Probing**
* Split the `MOVIEPROBE_MASTER` file in the convenient subfiles *p**
* Run `driverFlowFieldMovie.sh` in PROBEMODE. It will generate the file `bounds.dat` in the same directory as `MOVIEPROBE_MASTER`.
```
  parallel bash src/PostProcessing/driverFlowFieldMovie.sh {} 'PROBEMODE' ::: path/to/p*
```
4. **Create Plotting File**
```python
  python src/PostProcessing/createInputs.py PROBEMODE path/to/movieDNS/masterFile path/to/datFile path/to/store/desired/inputFile
```
5. **Generate Movies**
3. Divide DNS input in separate files, _z*_, appropriately.
4. Perform DNS with appropriate number of restarts, so far typically used 400
5. Divide the **MOVIEPROBE_MASTER** into appropriate number of files, _p*_
6. Generate file with the bounds **bounds.dat**, using the flag __PROBEMODE__:
```
  parallel bash src/DNS/PostProcessing/driverFlowFieldMovie.sh {} 'PROBEMODE' ::: path/to/p* 
```
7. The file **bounds.dat** has been created in the directory of **MOVIEPROBE_MASTER**. Now we need to create the input file with the bounds integrated, **MOVIELIST_MASTER**, to create the movies. 
```python
  python src/PostProcessing/createInputs.py MOVIEMODE path/to/datFile path/to/store/desired/inputFile
```
8. Divide the **MOVIELIST_MASTER** into appropriate number of files, _z*_
9. Finally, create the movies:
```
  parallel bash src/DNS/PostProcessing/driverFlowFieldMovie.sh {} 'MOVIEMODE' ::: path/to/z* 
```

## How to create Surface Velocity Movies 

###### Much Simpler
1. Create DNS input file with *TU* in the column of time units, not-specified.
2. Use python code **createInputs.py** to create the input file for the probe mode. This will substitute *TU* in the input file for the DNS for the corresponding time units for 2 periods, and will create the file **MOVIEPROBE_MASTER** where desired (for Flow Field Movies). The command is the following:
```python
  python src/PostProcessing/createInputs.py PROBEMODE path/to/movieDNS/masterFile path/to/datFile path/to/store/desired/inputFile
```
3. Divide DNS input in separate files appropriately.
4. Perform DNS with appropriate number of restarts, so far typically used 400
5. Finally, create the movies:
```
  parallel bash src/DNS/PostProcessing/driverSurfVelocMovie.sh {} 'MOVIEMODE' ::: path/to/DNS/z* 
```
